facial recognition in html5

Hi everyone!

I'm new to this website.
I'm working on an app on the phone and now I'm looking for html5 code for facial recognition.

I saw the show person of interest this year and think it is kinda awesome!
Is there someone that could code the interface of the machine in html5?
or just something that looks like it?

I would like boxes that at least recognize a head and that can be pinned with a name.
I prefer the boxes to have the colors yellow white and red.

I could have aseked chatgpt, but I have no time for that.
I'm willing to pay â‚¬400, not dollar's but euro's
